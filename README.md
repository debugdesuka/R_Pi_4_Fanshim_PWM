# R_Pi_4_Fanshim_PWM
Control FanShim Fan using PWM
Working version (Version 37) of Fanshim PWM control with some earlier files for temperature control that use the same classes etc.
Retained for reference only since next step is to incorporate new code from /text_buffer and remove "037" from file names.

This will be such a drastic change that will not attempt to use GitHub to manage the initial changes.

Next stage is to start in the repository "RPi4_Python_FanshimPWM_Temperature_Control_with_logging" to build up the complete system.
